## üõ†Ô∏è Enhancing with Real TensorFlow

### Installation

To enhance accuracy with real TensorFlow:

1. **Run Setup Script**:

   ```bash
   python setup_tensorflow.py
   ```

2. **Manual Installation**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-ml.txt
   ```

### Verification

Verify TensorFlow installation:

```bash
python verify_tensorflow_integration.py
```

## üß™ Testing ML Features

### Automated Testing

Run the test script to verify all features:

```bash
python test_tensorflow_integration.py
```

### Manual Testing

1. Start the application: `python app.py`
2. Access the web interface: `http://localhost:5000`
3. Navigate to AI Dashboard or API endpoints
4. Test each feature individually

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Model Loading

- Models load once at application startup
- Memory-optimized for production environments
- Lazy loading for infrequently used models

### Prediction Speed

- Real-time predictions for all features
- Caching for frequently requested predictions
- Batch processing for bulk operations

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. TensorFlow Not Found

**Solution**: The system automatically uses mock implementations. No action required for basic functionality.

#### 2. Slow Predictions

**Solution**: Ensure adequate system resources. Consider upgrading to a more powerful machine for real TensorFlow.

#### 3. API Errors

**Solution**: Verify the application is running and the endpoint URLs are correct.

### Debugging Steps

1. Check TensorFlow status: `GET /api/tensorflow/status`
2. Verify user authentication for student-specific features
3. Review application logs for error messages
4. Run verification script: `python verify_tensorflow_integration.py`

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Natural Language Processing**: Analyze book content for better recommendations
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Process user reviews for preference insights
3. **Advanced Forecasting**: Multi-variable models for improved accuracy
4. **Continuous Learning**: Models that improve with usage data
5. **A/B Testing**: Compare different recommendation algorithms
