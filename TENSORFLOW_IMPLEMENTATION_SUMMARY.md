## üß† TensorFlow Compatibility

The implementation includes a comprehensive TensorFlow compatibility layer that ensures:

- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Fallback to mock implementations when TensorFlow installation fails
- Seamless integration without code changes between real and mock TensorFlow

## üåê API Endpoints

All TensorFlow features are accessible through RESTful API endpoints:

- `/api/tensorflow/status` - System status check
- `/api/tensorflow/recommendations` - Personalized book recommendations
- `/api/tensorflow/demand_forecast` - Library-wide demand forecasting
- `/api/tensorflow/fine_prediction` - Fine amount prediction
- `/api/tensorflow/due_date_tracking` - Due date compliance tracking
- `/api/tensorflow/book_demand/{book_id}` - Individual book demand forecasting

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Integration

The frontend includes dedicated interfaces for:

- AI Dashboard (`/tensorflow-dashboard.html`)
- Book Recommendations (`/tensorflow-recommendations.html`)
- Integration with student dashboard

## üì¶ Installation

### With TensorFlow (Recommended)

```bash
pip install -r requirements-ml.txt
```

### Without TensorFlow (Mock Implementation)

The system automatically uses mock TensorFlow implementations that provide the same functionality with reduced accuracy.

## üß™ Testing

Run the test script to verify all TensorFlow features:

```bash
python test_tensorflow_integration.py
```

## üìö Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in:

- `ML_FEATURES.md` - Comprehensive ML features guide
- `README.md` - Updated main documentation with ML features
- Inline code comments in all TensorFlow-related files

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **TensorFlow Installation Failures**: Use mock implementations automatically
2. **Version Conflicts**: Use tensorflow==2.15.0 for best compatibility
3. **Platform Issues**: Specific instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux
4. **Performance**: Models optimized for production environments

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:

1. Natural Language Processing for book content analysis
2. Sentiment analysis for user reviews
3. Advanced forecasting with multi-variable models
4. Continuous learning models that improve with usage
5. A/B testing for recommendation algorithms

This implementation provides a comprehensive machine learning enhancement to the Library Management System while maintaining compatibility and ease of use.
